## My Thoughts

I found this video interesting for its predictions and picture of the cybersecurity scene in the industry. While short, the speaker gives a good overview of cybersecurity trends and technology trends that are important in the industry. What I found especially interesting were his predictions regarding the use of AI in malicious attacks and how cybersecurity must adapt and predict these methods of attacks with different techniques.

### Comments from Ryan Horng

I definitely agree with the speaker about Deep Fakes and Hallucinations. One particular AI that does hallucinations would be Brave browser's AI summarizer, which pulls data from other websites. Depending on what you're searching up, you can get very contrasting results and answers from it. In terms of Deep Fakes, we see a lot of celebrity and politican deep fakes circulating on social media, and there are probably hundreds of voice fakers on the internet, so it is definitely something to be concerned about in the near future.
